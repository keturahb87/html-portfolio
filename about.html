<p>I was born in Nashua, IA, but I would call Oelwein, IA my childhood home.  
    I was home schooled along with my brothers and sisters through grade 6 at which 
    point we joined a Christian school where I finished the rest of my education.  
    I graduated early from Faith Christian Learning Center 2005 a few months early, 
    because I couldn’t wait.  My first “real” job was picking strawberries at the 
    Corner Market at age 14.  It was only a summer job so with the recommendation 
    from my mother I was hired at the best local Italian restaurant Leo’s.  I spent 
    a total of 9 years working at Leo’s and to this day it has been the best job I 
    ever had.  I made friends, memories, and countless pans of lasagna.</p>

<p>In 2006 I went to school at La’James Internation College of cosmetology for 
    massage therapy.  The course was attractive to me because it was only 6 months 
    long and I could start working as soon as I passed my boards.  I will admit 
    that it took me two tries to pass the exam. Between starting school and passing 
    the boards I got married.  The date was 7/7/7.  Yes, we were those people. 
    An ironic choice because our marriage didn’t last.  My first job as a LMT was 
    at Williams Wellness Center in Oelwein.  I worked here for around 18 months.</p>

<p>September 2011 we (my now ex-husband, my one of my brothers, and myself) moved to 
    ape Coral, Fl.  After floundering around for a year or two on Fort Myers Beach and 
    working several hospitality jobs in restaurants and housekeeping, along with 
    getting a divorce, I started my career over as a LMT at Heart and Soul Massage 
    Therapy.  I worked there for 2 years before going to skin school to be an 
    Esthetician.  Another year passed and I started my own business. I’m blessed to
    say I spent the next 8 years building a wonderful clientele giving facials and
    massages.  I have met so many amazing people I will never forget and some I 
    still talk to.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, I have decided to become a Web Developer.  I love my 
    work as a healer, but I can not do it forever.  I am intrigued by the 
    opportunities offered by web design and the coding world.  I’m currently 
    pursuing a certification in Front End Software Development.  I enjoy the 
    challenge of learning something new and developing my skills to problem 
    solve and create.  I hope to gain employment somewhere in health care as my 
    LMT license is held by the Board of Health and I have experience in this field.</p>p>
